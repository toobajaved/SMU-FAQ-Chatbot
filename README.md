# **SMU FAQ Chatbot: AI vs. Rules-Based Comparison**

Developed for CSCI 3482 - Artificial Intelligence (Fall 2024), this project compares two different approaches for building a university FAQ chatbot:

1.  **AI-Based Chatbot** â€“ Uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with MiniLM-L6-V2 for embedding retrieval and OpenAI GPT-3.5 for response generation.
2.  **Rules-Based Chatbot** â€“ A manually defined chatbot that matches user input to predefined responses.

This project includes a full implementation of both chatbots and a comparative analysis of their performance in terms of accuracy, usability, scalability, and response time.

## **Project Overview**

### **Objective**

The goal of this project is to evaluate how well an AI-powered chatbot performs compared to a traditional rules-based chatbot when answering Saint Maryâ€™s University (SMU) FAQs.

### **Key Features**

-   AI Chatbot: Uses semantic search and GPT-3.5 to generate responses dynamically.
-   Rules-Based Chatbot: Matches user queries to predefined responses.
-   Comparative Analysis: Evaluates complexity, accuracy, response time, usability, and user experience.

## **How to Run the Chatbots**

### **Option 1: Running the AI Chatbot (Google Colab & Anvil Deployment)**

1.  **Clone the repository**
    
    -   Open a terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SMU-FAQ-Chatbot.git
cd SMU-FAQ-Chatbot
```
2. **aibot.ipynb in Google Colab**

-   Download and open `AI_Chatbot.ipynb` in Google Colab.
-   Install the required dependencies by running:
```
!pip install datasets faiss-cpu transformers openai anvil-uplink
```

-    Replace `openai.api_key` with your **OpenAI API key**.
-   **Run All Cells**
    
    -   Execute all cells to load the dataset, initialize FAISS, and deploy the chatbot.
    -   The chatbot will be accessible via **Anvil** at:  
        **[https://bountiful-qualified-vehicle.anvil.app/](https://bountiful-qualified-vehicle.anvil.app/)**
        
----------

### **Option 2: Running the Rules-Based Chatbot (Localhost Server)**

1.  **Install Python Dependencies**
    -   Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   pip install http.server
   ```
  2.  **Run the Server**

-   Start the chatbot by running:
   ```
   `python server.py
   ```
   3. **Access the Chatbot**

-   Open your web browser and go to **[http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)**
-   The chatbot will be available for interaction.## **Comparative Analysis Summary**

### **Comparison Between AI-Based and Rules-Based Chatbot**



**Complexity**

AI: High â€“ Uses retrieval-augmented generation with FAISS & GPT-3.5

Rules-based: Low â€“ Uses string matching and predefined responses

**Accuracy**

AI: High â€“ Handles variations in user queries

Rules-based: High â€“ If user input matches predefined rules

**Response Time**

AI: 1.5â€“3 sec (slower due to embedding retrieval & generation)

Rules-based: 50 ms (instantaneous)

**Usability**

AI: High â€“ Handles typos, synonyms, and context

Rules-based: Low â€“ Requires exact keyword matching

**User Experience**

AI: More natural responses but slower

Rules-based: Fast but rigid and repetitive

## **Dataset Information**

The FAQ dataset was **curated by Tooba Javed**, who collected and cleaned over **260+ FAQs** from SMUâ€™s website.

-   **Dataset Available on Hugging Face**:  
    **[https://huggingface.co/datasets/tootooba/SMU_FAQDataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tootooba/SMU_FAQDataset)**

----------

## **Future Improvements**

-   **Expand Dataset**: Add more question-answer pairs to improve AI chatbot accuracy.
-   **Optimize Response Time**: Experiment with more efficient retrieval techniques.
-   **Enhance Rules-Based Chatbot**: Implement NLP-based intent detection for more flexible responses.
